1) The first waveform is obtained after running the testbench directly without adding any other signals to view in the waveform.

2) The second waveform is obtained after adding all the signals of the slave module to view how the MAC unit works.

3) The second waveform is obtained after adding the DUT signals to the waveform to view all the signals involved with the top module.
