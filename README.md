# axi4-lite-mac-accelerator
Designed a SystemVerilog AXI4-Lite–controlled MAC accelerator with a register-based interface. The design cleanly separates control and datapath logic, uses a self-clearing start command, supports accumulation across multiple operations, and is verified using a structured testbench and waveforms.
